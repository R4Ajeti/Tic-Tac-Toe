## Project 1: OOP ([Tic-Tac-Toe]).

This is a microverse project. Click to know more about [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).
Remember Tic Tac Toe? See Wikipedia if you can’t remember the rules, or if you haven’t ever played. It involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop… all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound OOP sea legs. Let’s build it! 

## Assignment

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.
* Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game… What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.
* Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.
* Post your solution below, then check out the example solution provided.
